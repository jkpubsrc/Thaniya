Why this module?
----------------

It would be easy to run the Thaniya backup system as `root` to have best possibilities to reconfigure and control the system. (Background: Thaniya uses system accounts to provide endpoints for uploads.) However this would be a bad design: Running a python application as `root` must be considered as a security problem! There might be at least a theoretical possibility for some kind of bug that could potentionally be exploited by regular users. Therefore the Thaniya server is designed to **not** run as `root`.

But if the server does not run as `root` a problem exists: The server must assign new passwords to system accounts and access data uploaded to that system accounts. To compensate for this problem this module has been written: It provides a simple facility to run bash scripts as `root`.
